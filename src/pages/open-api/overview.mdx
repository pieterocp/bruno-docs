# OpenAPI and Bruno

OpenAPI specification (AOS) is a standard format for reading and describing the RESTful APIs. It provides a framework for defining apis, endpoints, auth, headers and etc. This format is easy to read and maintain API documentations.

Bruno allows you to work with OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files in a number of ways:

- [Creating a collection from an OAS file import](./importOAS.mdx)
- [Exporting a collection as an OAS file](./exportOAS.mdx) <PremiumBadge />
- [Viewing and Designing an OAS file](./createOAS.mdx) <PremiumBadge />
